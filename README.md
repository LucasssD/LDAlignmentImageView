# LDAlignmentImageView
UIImageView subclass with simple methods to align and scale image inside UIImageView.

## Demo:
![](https://github.com/LucasssD/LDAlignmentImageView/blob/master/demo.gif)

## Available properties:

- `correctImage` (`UIImage`; use this instead of the standard `UIImageView`â€™s `image` property)

- `imageVerticalAlignment` (Top, Center, Bottom)

- `imageHorizontalAlignment` (Left, Center, Right)
  
- `imageContentMode` (Original size, Scale to Fill, Scale Aspect Fill, Scale Aspect Fit)

__Note:__ the example has not been updated to include the image duplication fix for iOS 13.

## Animatable
All changes can be easly animated by putting them in animation block, for example

```objective-c
[UIView animateWithDuration:0.4  animations:^{
    ldImageAlignmentView.imageVerticalAlignment = LDImageVerticalAlignmentCenter;
    ldImageAlignmentView.imageHorizontalAlignment= LDImageHorizontalAlignmentLeft;
    ldImageAlignmentView.imageContentMode = LDImageContentModeScaleToFill;
}];
```
